# GeneralSocksProxy
This item is rewriting based on the shadowsocks developed by clowwindy.  
And replaced some libs used on osx platform only.

### Install
#### OSX
  1. cd depends && ./build_depends.sh
  2. cd ../ && cmake -G "Xcode" ../
  3. using xcode to build the app


### Todo
The ios and android version need some time :)

### Note
All the replaced libs are downloaded from the official site.   
And you could download all these libs by yourself with little modification to the build_depends.sh
